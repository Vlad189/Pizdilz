 MOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Moldavia came about as a result of the civil war in Romania after World War 1 between the Nationalists and the King. Despite a number of major military defeats and defeats the Nationalists were able to withdraw across the river and gain a foothold in Moldavia and after inflicting numerous losses they were able to impose peace on the King. Their policy of uniting the Romanians brought little but discontent among the population and in 1932 power was "transferred" first to more moderate nationalists and militarists and then to the democrats."
 CRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crimean state appeared 5 years ago and its start was very cheerful. Not only Crimea, but also the territories of Tavria were given to it. Rapid and streaming economic growth and demographic boom made all the obvious problems for Crimea unimportant. \n\n At the same time, there is still political uncertainty, everything from Russian nationalists to radical Islamists are raging in Crimea, and they are all about to start a struggle for power, and it is unknown whether this struggle will be fatal for Crimea or not"
 CRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Subcarpathian Rus appeared as a result of a joint strike of workers in 1935. There were strikes by loggers in the villages, but the tension was increasing. The speeches were accompanied by political demonstrations under the slogans of regional autonomy. People protested against exorbitant taxes, demanded work and monetary assistance to starving peasants. Approximately 140 hunger strikes took place. The Czechs sent the gendarmerie, but nothing came of it. Edvar Banoš called for an emergency meeting in the Prague parliament, where the majority of deputies voted for the region's autonomy. Autonomy of the Central Russian People's Party. There are many internal problems and rumors in the region."

Resources and production capacities are distributed according to social needs, and not on the basis of profit. The absence of private ownership of the means of production and products prevents the exploitation of some people by others. In general , anarchist economics aims to satisfy the needs of the entire society equally, without allowing the privatization or commercialization of public resources.n\n On the other hand, anarcho-capitalism assumes that the free market can independently manage the economy.Freedom of enterprise stimulates innovation and development, which, in turn, increases social welfare.The absence of the state and taxes reduces bureaucracy and increases personal freedom.In such a system, each person has the right to property and the freedom to choose how to use their resources.n\nDespite the differences in approaches to the economy, both concepts pursue a common goal - the creation of a society that satisfies the needs of all its members. The differences lie in how they achieve this goal. In anarchism, this is achieved through the collective organization of production and distribution of resources on the principle of equality, and in anarcho-capitalism, through the free market and individual freedom of choice.

The tax system and economic policy, which is strange to many, has had a huge impact on the spending and income of companies and private businesses in the country, and since then the economy has begun to shut down, many businesses and industries have closed, and there has been a large-scale impoverishment of the population. \There was a huge hole in the budget and unfortunately there was nothing better to do than to print money and raise the interest rates at the National Bank of Ukraine. Against the background of the exit of business from the country, the massive increase in prices due to the deficit of goods and the impoverishment of the population, as well as the government's attempts to patch up the budget holes the inflation reached 250%. For a certain period the hryvnia was worthless. Through titanic efforts and a difficult balance sheet the Ukrainian government was able to rehabilitate the economy and save the hryvnia, but the Ukrainian currency is still in a deplorable state, prices are still out of touch, business is not ready to return to the country, the population is still on the brink of poverty and no transactions in hryvnia at all \n\n The next few years will be too hard both for Ukraine and its population and there is no telling if it will survive these tough times"

 ukraine.168.d:0 "Nikolai Sciborsky, a right-wing politician and nationalist known throughout Ukraine, spent many years in Austria and later in Germany developing his concept of Naziocracy. \n\n In his opinion, the concept of Naziocracy is a rather specific concept of the state system that is very similar to that of Nazism. The essence of Naciocracy is the power of the nation in the state, but it is a specific and single, dominant nation. \n\n Sciborsky's ideas go back to his unity with the nation and Ukrainians, as well as his opposition to all those who interfere with the existence of Ukraine and its nation. Sciborsky is not shy of expression, he has been threatened several times and maybe even assassinated, but he is not bent to his ideas and is ready to go all the way. \n\n Ukrainian nation and its foundation are directly reflected in Sciborsky's ideas and views. Ukrainian society is a society of agrarians and Christians transitioning into an era of heavy technology and industrialization. This approach is depicted both in his political and economic program, as well as in the flag and logo of his party and movement "The Nation of Ukraine" where the white-painted symbol known as "National Idea" represents the Ukrainian state and its nation that under the pressure of the world and necessities is moving from an agrarian system to an industrial one, all this surrounded by a black canvas that depicts the abyss of folly and madness that surrounds the Ukrainian nation.

We managed to break through the border and take Konstantinovka, Sosny, Redkovichi, Orlevo and even managed to enter the small town of Luban. There was almost no fighting except for the encircling town of Luban. We were able to enter that town and take all the roads leading to it. \Unfortunately, on the 3rd or 4th day of fighting the Red Army brought reinforcements and a bloody fight began. Despite the fact that our troops were entrenched, it was unrealistically hard and even with the support of our air force the Red Army was able to inflict great damage on us. After a major but fortunately unsuccessful Soviet offensive on Redkovici, we realized that all tasks had been completed and it was time to pull back. \n\n spite of the fact that we retreated, we managed to intimidate the USSR and divert it from the war in the north and uncover all the shortcomings of the Red Army. Yes, we lost a lot of men, but in many areas our losses were 1 in 7 or even 1 in 13, which means that we have accomplished all our tasks with minimal losses."

Our troops marched through the village of Oboz directly to the settlement of Sosny. At the border crossing we were met first with heavy fire from small arms, and then we were covered with artillery and mortars. Our battalions suffered great losses. \n\n During the next 24 hours we brought a couple of motorized regiments and even 10 tanks, but they didn't make things better either. We took heavy losses, but continued to hold on to some of the small villages on the border. \n\n later, a Soviet counter-attack followed, drove us back and we were forced to go on the defensive. Only a few days later the Soviets stopped their bloody butchery assaults and there was a lull on the border."

 ukraine.176.t:0 "History of the OUN"
 ukraine.176.d:0 "Ukrainian nationalists originated during the German-Austrian occupation of Ukraine. Protonationalism and right-wing tendencies among the ideas were present even before the Crimean War and the whole independence of the Cossack Republic, but it was at the time when Ukraine was occupied that these ideas reached their logical development and gained an extremely wide popularity. In the first half of the 20s, the newly born OUN receded into the background. Ukraine was almost completely reborn within its ethnic boundaries, and the Ukrainian nation was just spreading its wings. The real problems began after the invasion of Poland and the collapse of the front. The OUN and its few armed formations were divided among the states and separated. Eventually almost all of the east went to the USSR, Galicia and Volhynia to Poland. The OUN was divided. Konovalets and other leaders of the OUN called the Eastern OUN left Ukraine and moved to Germany, while the young and ambitious Sciborski wanted peace and quiet to develop his progressive ideology "Naziocracy" moved to Vienna where he lived for the next few years. In turn, Bandera and his supporters were able to organize the UPA. They terrorized all Polish armed formations that entered the territory of Galicia and Volyn, not giving the Polish Chancellery even a day without news from Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk or Lutsk and Khmelnitsky. \n\n The turning point in determining the course of the OUN was the Civil War. Konovalets and Melnik began a large-scale gathering of Ukrainians abroad to enter Ukraine. While the Anarchists and Skoropadskyi fanatics were struggling to change the government, Melnik and Konovalets wanted with the help of 10-30 thousand soldiers to enter the territory of Ukraine and start an uprising and overthrow both "ghouls", thereby establishing their power in Ukraine. Bandera, on the other hand, continued his partisan activities in Poland, it was the unity of Ukraine that was important to him, not who was at the helm. \n\n The plan of Melnik and Konovalets failed. They did not manage to infiltrate through the border during the civil war and were only able to form themselves into a full-fledged force when Petliura was already seated in the president's cabinet. Melnik and Konovalets decided not to abandon their plan and began to destroy the system and even its competitors. Many politicians, communists, democrats, anarchists, particularly Makhno, and many others were murdered. Petliura began to hunt Konovalts and he, so as not to risk his entire organization, surrendered to the government of Ukraine. He handed the organization over to Melnik, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Sciborsky, having already realized his ideas and ideology, returned to Ukraine, but not in the underground, but as a well-known and legal politician. \n\n This is how the once great and powerful OUN split into Bandera, who wanted to bring the Ukrainian lands back home, the opposition, armed against Petlyura, in the form of Melnik, who wanted to throw him out by all means, and Sciborski, who wanted to play by the rules and had long been competing with politicians of the higher ranks such as Mikhnovsky, Petlyura or Vinnichenko. It is not known whose strategy will be successful and who will realize his dreams, what is known is that this process will be difficult not only for Ukraine, but also for the split OUN."

 ukraine.198.d:0 "Bolbochan, a truly talented general and military commander, is in fact the one who brought Crimea to Ukraine and the one who could defeat the Red Army in Crimea.  In 1921 Skoropadsky put Bolbochan in charge of the Crimean operation. A major battle was brewing between Vlasov, a general of the Red Army, and Bolbochan, a general of the Ukrainian Army. Bolbochan realized the necessity of a rapid defeat of Vlasov's large grouping in the Crimea, and using the effect of surprise and paralysis of command, he captured the Crimea in less than a week, and during his autumn campaign he liberated the Donbas and took Rostov. His popularity grew and he became one of the main symbols of Ukraine and its independence, so Skoropadsky removed him from the southern front and ordered him to command the garrison in Crimea. \n\n After his actual deportation to the Crimea, Bolbochan became close to Vlasov. Not so much out of a desire for friendship as out of a desire to realize the shortcomings of the command and to gain experience, and as time went on, as Ukraine began to suffer defeat after defeat and the battle for Crimea became increasingly inevitable, he tried to realize how not to do when defending the peninsula. Also Bolbochan, though he did not share Vlasov's dreams of a great Russia, was interested in his train of thought, and according to many contemporaries, it was then that Bolbochan came to the concept of an Inter-Sea and a great Ukraine. \n\n later, when the Red Army encircled the Donbass, separatist tendencies began to grow in the Crimea, from a desire for communist peace to the revival of the Khanate. Bolbochan was able to break through to Skoropadsky and propose to him a project of independence of Crimea with the temporary transfer of Tavria, fortunately Hetman accepted the project, though with obvious dissatisfaction. \n\n A few years later, the Winter Civil War broke out. Bolbochan of course sided with Skoropadsky, he brought his side many victories and triumphs, but for the same reasons as before he was removed from his post and Bolbochan resigned. Later the war was over, Petliura became ruler of Ukraine, and Bolbochan returned to his place, though now he was fiercely despising everyone in passing, maintaining contact with Vlasov and not forgetting his dreams and hopes for a great Ukraine."

We expected the enemy to go south, but he went in the direction of the Kiev dam and defeated us near the village of Moshun took Lutizh, Starye Petrevtsy and Novye Petrevtsy and then advanced to Vyshgorod. \n\n the enemy was able to take the city and their equipment drove along the dam to the other side of the city, but the insane tactic of destroying the ground beneath them destroyed their logistics and the losses they suffered became critical. Similar "mutinies" began to occur in many other cities, so we began to act quickly, we struck hard on Vyshgorod, and our best tank units entered Gostomel. The uprising was defeated, but its participants are still hiding in the forests near Kiev, and we are sure that if we can't clear them out, it will play a cruel trick on us in the future."

We immediately realized what the problem was and sent a special unit to the station and heavy fighting ensued. There was a heavy assault and later a cleansing of enemy positions, judging by the shouts and posters on the walls it was the same "anarchists" as in Gostomel. By the time the battle for the engine room began, the enemy realized that their chances were slim and blew up everything they could. \Thank God the dam exploded only 15%, but the powerful flow of water and the fragility of the structure led to the fact that about 40% of the dam was destroyed and the water column went to the Ukrainian capital. The left, lower bank was in danger. The Dnieper began to overflow its banks, the water began to flood many streets and after a couple of hours, the buildings began to flood. As a result, the water overflowed 5 kilometers on the left bank and 3 kilometers on the right bank. We were able to keep the city from being completely flooded, but many buildings were destroyed and the city itself was left without power for almost a month. Businesses did not work, and people did not have time to do anything and died in their own apartments. Our capital will never recover from such a blow"

 ukraine.208.d:0 "It's been a turbulent time for Ukraine lately, but what it was will now seem like just flowers and a mere glimpse. Junior officer Platon Donetsko, a warrior of the Tarom partisans, supported the Anarcho-Apocalyptic movements that have raged so violently in Ukraine since the last elections. He gathered about 7,000 soldiers in the city of Krivoy Rog and announced a "march of justice" moving north toward Kiev. The army expected to have enough time to assemble and strike the marching soldiers, but the support of the population proved to be far greater in Donetsk than in the rest of the official army.  The path of the marchers purposely went through populated areas in order to gather as many fans as possible. When the rebel army entered Kropivnitsky their number was already more than 50,000 soldiers and 40 thousand of them moved in the direction of Uman and the remaining 10 thousand marched to Cherkassy. In the meantime, we were able to gather only about 30 thousand soldiers to repel the attack, those who met the marchers and resisted went over to their side, so we had to prepare ideologically. \n\n By the evening of the first day of the march, the 65,000-strong group had already entered Uman. The brave 500 soldiers of the territorial defense tried to fight back, but they failed and the city was surrendered.  The next morning the reorganized 80,000-strong group marched on Bila Tserkva, by which time Cherkassy had already been occupied. Donetsko was clever and his "worm" was spreading his paws in all directions, expanding his territory and taking more and more cities under control, sucking people out of our cities and sending them to Kiev. By the evening of the second day about 130,000 soldiers had entered the White Church and occupied the Kiev area from Skvir to Rokitnoye. Now they were preparing to advance on Kiev, and our 50,000-strong armada was preparing to meet them. \n\n The hard battle began. The enemy went around the capital and took such important cities as Vasilkov, Gostomel, Vyshgorod and Brovary with Borispol on the other side of Kiev, the capital was surrounded and the enemy entered the city. For the first few hours we held our ground, albeit with territorial losses, but then chaos ensued. Radical Nazis, Stalinists, Communists, Democratic Coalition troops and even other subspecies of anarchists rose up in large-scale uprisings, and the capital city was a meat grinder. A similar carnage from the capital spread to other cities, and later to the whole country. Fronts, generals, orders, leaders, none of this existed. There was only chaos, destruction and a frantic, bloody meat grinder that plunged the whole country into hell. All the leaders of all the movements after a month of fighting no longer saw any prospects in Ukraine and fled abroad, while many armies laid down their arms and moved on to civilian life. \n\n also against this backdrop, Moldova entered Odessa, Crimea forced the Dnieper River and entered Mykolaiv, and the USSR occupied Mozyr. And so the land that once called itself Ukraine remained, broken, defeated and without a government, just a bunch of groups and communes banding together for a more profitable existence and enemies wanting to take the rest of the country."

It did not matter whether it was short or long term, the potential of the "SS country" was enormous, and its economic growth rate and the development of its military machine even greater. The Reich was losing on all parameters and realizing this Himler started the "march of justice" to Berlin, and in fact declared war on the Reich and Hitler.

Believing that his experience and dedication will benefit the SS and our attempt to thwart the madman Hitler, Himmler considers promoting Puot to General in the ranks of the Schutzestaffel. On Reichsfuehrer Himmler's orders, Edgar Puot was appointed an officer in the 33rd Waffen-SS Division "Charlemagne". His role in French social affairs became even more important as he was sent to the occupied territories where Schutzestaffel supporters were badly needed. Puo was to become an important player in the intrigue and manipulation of French collaborators. \n\n With his arrival in the occupied territories, Edgar Puot began to actively promote anti-Bolshevik and anti-Schutzstaffel ideas and attract Schutzestaffel supporters. He could become a player in the complex game of influence between the leaders of Marshall Pitin and General De Gaulle, using his charisma and persuasion to strengthen Schutzestaffel's position in the occupied territories of France. \n\n Puot thus became a key figure in the French social conflict, using his abilities and position in the Waffen-SS to advance Schutzestaffel's interests. His activities provoked mixed reactions among the French population, and the future of France now lay largely in the hands of this French collaborator, Edgar Puot."

He knew that there were ambitious ideals roaming around inside the country that he wanted to fulfill in order to realize Heinrich Himmler's plan to overthrow Hitler and his supporters. \n\n However, in order to successfully carry out his plans, Edgar Puo realized that it was necessary to have a reliable team that shared his goals and ideology. Therefore, he decided to ask Heinrich Himmler to create his own "Schutzstaffel France". Letter to Himmler from Edgar Puo:\n\n "Dear Reichsführer Himmler, \n\n I gratefully accept the promotion to the rank of Oberstgruppenführer and the assignment of an important mission in occupied France. I am fully committed to the SS and your ideals, and I believe that our next important task must be to overthrow Hitler and his followers in order to build a new future for our homeland. \n\n\n I am sure that we have worthy candidates who are ready to join Schutzstaffel France and contribute to our common cause. With such a team, I am confident that we can maximize our success in our efforts to strengthen SS and our movement. \n\nWith deepest respect,\nObergruppenführer Edgar Puo" Thus, Edgar Puo sent his proposal to Heinrich Himmler for the creation of a separate "Schutzstaffel France", which would be his loyal instrument in confronting Hitler and his supporters, as well as in the realization of the general ideology of the SS in France."

 ukraine.245.d:0 "An important question has arisen about the recognition of Ukrainians on an equal footing with Germans in the SS-Ordensstaat of Ukraine in order to realize the plans and ideas of the SS regarding the Reich. To make the right decision, we need to consider two possible options: to recognize only Ukrainians serving in the army, or to recognize the entire population. \n\n if we recognize only Ukrainians serving in the army, this approach will help to emphasize the loyalty of the Ukrainian military to the SS Ordensstaat of Ukraine and their devotion to SS ideas. \n It will lead to strengthening the military power and unity of the armed forces of the SS Ordensstaat of Ukraine, which can be an important factor in the struggle for power and influence in Germany. On the downside, limiting recognition only at the army level could create a division between the Ukrainian military and the rest of the population, potentially causing public discontent and conflict within the country. Not all Ukrainians who would like to serve in the military can receive recognition and equal opportunities, which will directly affect our economy and social condition. \n With the recognition of the entire population, we can confidently say that full recognition of all Ukrainians will show the attention and care of the SS Ordensstaat of Ukraine for its citizens, which can strengthen the loyalty of the population and reduce social tensions. It will allow to use the potential and talents of all citizens for the development of the country and the realization of SS ideas. \n\n But, the inclusion of all Ukrainians in equal degree may cause fear and discontent on the part of the German population, who may consider it a threat to their cultural and social identity, which is very much feared by the leadership of the Reich and spoils the idea of Reichsführer Himmler in the SS Order. Some Ukrainians may remain skeptical and distrustful of the Order due to previous hostility during the Nazi regime and the pogroms of cities in search of communists. \n It is important to keep in mind that when making a decision, it is necessary to balance the interests and needs of different groups of people, as well as to ensure the harmonious development of the SS Ordensstaat of Ukraine as a whole. The decision may be difficult, but its correct realization contributes to the achievement of the goals and ideals of the SS in relation to the Reich."

The threat from the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) became a shadow hanging over the country. Pro-Soviet politicians were kicked out, and now an organized NKVD headquarters threatens the security and sovereignty of Ukraine. \n\n The situation has become critical, and decisive action is needed to prevent further destruction and chaos. Ukraine's top leaders decide to organize a special operation to destroy the NKVD headquarters. This will test the armed forces and their dedication to the common idea of defending their homeland. \n\n A plan of action is carefully developed, and forces gather around the idea of freeing Ukraine from this dangerous threat.

When state troops arrived in these cities it was too late, what they saw was a horror in reality, body parts of both Poles and Ukrainians were lying in the streets, the streets were covered in blood, the most horrible find was a head stuck on a street lamp in the center of Lutsk.

The Central Rada, with obvious but not the greatest compensation, lost its power, while the position of prime minister was eliminated. \n\n Mikhnovsky has now gained enough political power to pursue his own policies and introduce what he believes to be his best reforms without regard for other political forces, but that does not mean that the cabinet will simply obey the new leader.

Either the events were to come to a climax quickly and painlessly for the country, or end in disaster. \n\n The end came, and it was a happy one. Petliura and Mikhnovsky realized their inability to win a residual victory in this political struggle and decided to compromise their ambitions. \n\n At yesterday's congress of the democratic coalition a new leader of the coalition, Mazepa, a libertarian and minarchist, was chosen by joint decision. It is not clear where he will lead Ukraine, but now the Ukrainian government is united and has a clear and unshakable strategy of development."

At the expense of cheap labor in the form of poor people, a relatively favorable and safe environment for investment and also due to the various sectors of the Crimean economy, which attracted a variety of foreign companies. In 10 years Crimea has reached unprecedented growth rates and attracted more and more firms, growing economically and accumulating funds at the same time investing them in itself, thus becoming even more huge in terms of economy. \But the last years were critical for Crimea, the situation in Crimea and in the region became more and more tense, and the Crimean population was no longer ready to work in slave-like conditions, which is why many companies either reduced the sums that should have gone to Crimea, or changed it for the more profitable Moldova at all. \n\n At some point, everything became too critical. Foreign investors began to leave Crimea en masse, leaving the population unemployed and reducing the growth rate of the Crimean economy, and then causing it to fall.  By the way, the economy did not fall much. In many sectors, the growth rate decreased by 5-12%, and only in some companies began to incur losses, but it was enough for foreign companies to leave Crimea, turn its population into slaves and unemployed beggars, and the peninsula and the region into an unfit place for financing. \n\n There is a huge hole in the budget, many factories and plants are closed, the population suffers from hunger and poverty, there is no economic growth, goods on the shelves become scarce, wages either fall to obscenely low levels or are not paid at all.

 rusins.4.d:0 "Carpathian Rus received its independence only about a year ago and during this time the vacuum of power, ideologies and ideas has been rapidly filled. \n\n Despite the fact that Carpathian Rus has no full independence, but is a de facto puppet of the Czech Republic, Prague is unable to control all the processes in the young and recently born state, and they are truly crazy. \n\n Rallies, pickets, strikes, confrontations between political parties and large-scale dissatisfaction of the population with the current state system, all this, although hidden and not visible, does not give stability to the new state, but only on the contrary, inflames the atmosphere and makes the situation in the young state at least critical. What it will turn out to be for the Carpathians, the Czech Republic and Eastern Europe in principle, we will find out very soon, it seems."
 rusins.4.a:0 "We are in a sad situation"
 rusins.5.t:0 "Strengthening the government"
 rusins.5.d:0 "Our government has been woefully inefficient, and recent political conflicts and debates have only made our situation worse. \n\n Ultimately, sweeping reforms in legislation, temporary tax cuts, and reassignment of officials allowed us to make our government more efficient and eventually overcome instability. \n\n now that Zebere is in power, we can finally set a course and start an active, pro-Czech movement and finally arrive at something more than what we are now!"
 rusins.5.a:0 "The course is set!"
 rusins.6.t:0 "The rise of Pavel Tsebere's career"
 rusins.6.d:0 "The recent political instability and unrest in the country could certainly shake Cibere and his reputation, and maybe even destroy his career, but using his political experience and his unconditional talent he was able to maneuver through all the political problems and achieve unquestionable success in his career. \n\n Now, when all the problems have been eliminated, there are no competitors left, and the internal political situation has stabilized as never before, Cebere has become the main figure in Carpathian Rus and actually the national leader."
 rusins.6.a:0 "If not him, then who?"
 rusins.7.t:0 "Hungarian influence"
 rusins.7.d:0 "Our course is determined, but our potential and real enemies are unbreakable and they are all sharpening their knives to share such a tasty pie as us. \n\nHungary is no exception, after defining our political and ideological course and overcoming all the difficulties, Budapest is not ready to accept the fact that we are finally leaving its pathetic and slippery clutches and therefore tries as much as possible to keep and increase its influence in our state in order to have supporters in case of intervention or to have a direct influence on our decisions in peacetime!"
 rusins.7.a:0 "Damn Hungarians!"
 rusins.8.t:0 "[CRS.GetName] asks for Prešov"
 rusins.8.d:0 "Ruthenians densely populate this region and it is clear that they are asking for this region to somehow unite into a single state. \n\n On the one hand we can support the Ruthenian desire for unification and play along with their politicians in order to increase stability on the territory of our vassal, on the other hand supporting Ruthenian irredentism can play a bad game with us!"
 rusins.8.a:0 "Let the Ruthenians feel important"
 rusins.8.b:0 "Don't let the Ruthenians get caught up in independence, keep them in line!"
 rusins.9.t:0 "Czechoslovakia cedes Prešov"
 rusins.9.d:0 "Prague politicians apparently clearly realize that the Ruthenians are not to be trifled with, and therefore to support our aspirations for unification and the building of a single state is certainly the right and true decision!"
 rusins.9.a:0 "Brothers reunited!"
 rusins.10.t:0 "Agreement with the Axis"
 rusins.10.d:0 "It is no secret that the Axis, and Germany in particular, is planning to wipe Czechoslovakia off the face of the earth and then us without giving us a chance! \n\nTo avoid such an unenviable fate and not to fall into the clutches of Hungarians who only sleep and see how to destroy us we will have to conclude at least some agreements and negotiate with Berlin, the days of Czechoslovakia are numbered, and our euphoria is over, it's time to think seriously about what awaits us and how not to lose so desired by all our people and so recently obtained independence!"
 rusins.10.a:0 "We don't have a chance, we have to agree."
 rusins.10.b:0 "We will fight!"
 rusins.11.t:0 "Governor seizes power"
 rusins.11.d:0 "The Czech Republic and Carpathian Rus including are going through difficult times. Not only the territorial integrity of these states, but also their existence is under threat. \Against this background, an extremely inappropriate, but much decisive political struggle began in Carpathian Rus, in which Pavel Cebere and the governor of Transcarpathia Konstantin Grabar clashed. \In the end, Grabar emerged victorious from this difficult "battle". He is even more Czechophile than Zebere and sees no sense in the existence of Carpathian Rus without Bohemia. Now, against the background of the impending catastrophe, Grabar will do everything to save his people, the people of Czechoslovakia and actually keep these two states on the world map, let's see if he has enough strength and skills to pull it off"
 rusins.11.a:0 "Cibere was too weak"
 rusins.12.t:0 "The Problem of Russophiles"
 rusins.12.d:0 "After recent, difficult and shocking internal and external political events, Grabar, a Czechophile to the core, is faced with a difficult life choice. \n\n The Russophiles and Ukrainophiles are rebelling more than ever, the pro-Czech way gave nothing to the Carpathians and its population except suffering and instability, now Grabar will have to make a choice, whether to seek ties with Ukraine and completely lose independence or to support the idea of independence and self-sufficiency and finally start its own course of development."
 rusins.12.a:0 "Let's support Russophiles"
 rusins.12.b:0 "Let's support Ukrainians"
 rusins.13.t:0 "The Czechoslovak Crisis"
 rusins.13.d:0 "Munich Conference, we and our staunch ally and defender, Czechoslovakia, have been sold and torn to pieces and will most likely continue to be tormented. \n\n In order not to lose our independence and not to lose our chance to exist, we are forced to become stronger, more independent and, unfortunately, to distance ourselves from Czechoslovakia, taking control of our historical lands in Prešov."
 rusins.13.a:0 "We must act"
 rusins.14.t:0 "Czech general seizes power!"
 rusins.14.d:0 "Vojtech Luza, one of the most famous field marshals of the 20th century, he enjoys great prestige throughout eastern Europe. \n\n To his great regret, his homeland, Czechoslovakia, was gone and he was forced to migrate to Carpathian Rus. Realizing the need to save his homeland and realizing the need to resist the expansion of the Reich, he gathered a small army with exceptionally good intentions and led a coup in Carpathian Rus. \n\n Vojtech Lusa is now in power, but the situation in Europe continues to escalate and there is no telling how it will end!"
 rusins.14.a:0 "Terrible times..."
 rusins.15.t:0 "Elections"
 rusins.15.d:0 "Transcarpathia is in a difficult situation and it is at a crossroads between joining Ukraine and seeking protection under the wing of Kiev or still come to the "doctrine" of Fencik and take the path of independence seeking friendship with Budapest. \n\n This choice will be decisive for the whole Transcarpathia, independence with self-determination and nationalism or return to the historical homeland and turn into a rich, but completely non-self-governing region."
 rusins.15.a:0 "Augustin Voloshyn will lead Carpathian Ukraine to greatness!"
 rusins.15.b:0 "Stepan Fencik is a strong leader, which is exactly what we need!"
 rusins.16.t:0 "Carpathian Rus wants to secede"
 rusins.16.d:0 "Due to the tense situation inside our state, we were unable to keep track of the growth of Ukrainianophile and basically pro-Ukrainian sentiments in the society, and it turned out to be a big problem for us. \n\n Realize the potential of this situation, that officials in Ugvar, that politicians in Kiev coordinated and sent us an ultimatum with one single point, the complete and absolute independence of Carpathian Rus from Czechoslovakia".
 rusins.16.a:0 "There is no point in keeping them"
 rusins.16.b:0 "Rusins don't exist"
 rusins.17.t:0 "Freedom!"
 rusins.17.d:0 "Apparently not all, but a large part of the political and military leadership of Czechoslovakia realize that the Ukrainians are not to be trifled with and that not to follow us is a sure way to perdition. \n\n Now we are free, Ukrainians will strive for unification from Xian to Don and nothing and no one, no ideas or ideologies will stand in the way of this unification. As for us, we are finally free from the Czech shackles and ready to start the journey home!"
 rusins.17.a:0 "At last we have achieved it"
 rusins.18.t:0 "Carpathian Ukraine asks for protection"
 rusins.18.d:0 "Voloshyn and other pro-Ukrainian politicians who have seized power in Ukraine think they should be much closer to Ukraine. \n\n Purely in theory it may be risky, we can not calculate for sure what costs we will incur from this unification, but at the moment the accession of Transcarpathia, even in the form of autonomy, looks much more attractive than non-accession"
 rusins.18.a:0 "Let's take our brothers under our wing"
 rusins.18.b:0 "We have other plans for them"
 rusins.19.t:0 "We are now part of Ukraine"
 rusins.19.d:0 "Having weighed up all the pros and cons, Kiev politicians have come to one and very simple conclusion, an alliance with Transcarpathia is a must! \n\n Now we are at home, we are an autonomous Ukrainian republic within the strong, invincible and blooming Ukraine and now no one will prevent neither the great Ukrainian unification, nor our ambitions, and we have enough of them!"
